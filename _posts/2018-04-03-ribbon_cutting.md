The mission-driven organization “Community Forge” acquired the former Johnston Elementary School in July of 2017 and has been working daily for the past 9 months to transform the property into a community center. Today, the building is open again and now houses more than a dozen local businesses, co-working areas, education non-profits, arts organizations, community outreach groups, a youth after-school space, and weekly community events. On April 11th at 6PM, all are invited to attend the official Community Forge Ribbon Cutting, hosted by the Duquesne Small Business Development Center, to celebrate the progress to date.
