On July 18th, the mission-driven organization “Community Forge” acquired the Johnston Elementary School at 1256 Franklin Avenue from the Wilkinsburg School District.  Community Forge plans to transform the Johnston School into a community space that will be a home for small businesses, local events, municipal meetings, and educational programs. Since late 2016, Community Forge has been speaking with the School Board, City Council, the WCDC, and local Wilkinsburg residents about plans for the space.  Now, after securing financing from Bridgeway Capital, renovation is beginning, and the space is slated to open to the public by November 2017.
