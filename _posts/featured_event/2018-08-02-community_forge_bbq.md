Ghosts are coming to the former Johnston Elementary this Halloween season.
Community Forge is hosting a FREE Halloween get-together for the whole family on Saturday, October 27th, 4-7pm. We will have activities that every member of the family will enjoy including games, crafts, a scare room, and more.
