The original school atrium, the Atrium is a nexus for Community Forge.  It hosts
a beautiful 3-story tall ceiling with columns and is our largest event rental
space on the 1st floor. It is directly connected to additional Breakout rooms
available and the Kitchenette. The space has become a popular venue for
meetings, screenings, birthday parties, weddings, concerts and public
gatherings.  This room is sized 48 feet by 48 feet.
