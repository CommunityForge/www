Together, we are working to transform the Johnston Elementary School into a community space for opportunities in Wilkinsburg.

In 2012, Johnston Elementary closed its doors after serving Wilkinsburg for nearly a century.  With that closing, the borough lost a valuable resource.  Beyond acting as a center for education, Johnston Elementary housed community meetings and political events and was a source of energy for the neighborhood. We formed Community Forge in 2016 with the vision of bringing that energy back. Our goal is to attract mission-driven and socially-conscious businesses, events, and partners into Wilkinsburg.  We aim to use proceeds from tenancy to beautify the property, open public recreational spaces, and offer educational programs.

We are just beginning now, and if youâ€™d like join us in the space or learn more, please reach out at <a href="mailto:Hello@Forge.Community">Hello@Forge.Community</a>
