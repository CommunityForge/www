Johnston elementary school served Wilkinsburg for near a century
before closing its doors in 2012. With its closing, a valuable
resource was lost: beyond the direct loss of a school, the community
meetings and political events which had used the building after the
school day was over had to find space elsewhere if they were to continue.

Johnston elementary is not a special case. The loss of resources held in
common (organizations, opportunities, and spaces) is, one of the great
challenges facing cities in the 21st century. [We]({{ site.url }}/about)
formed Community Forge in 2016 as a response to exactly this problem.
Our goal is to bring mission-driven and socially conscious business into
Wilkinsburg and to feed proceeds from tenancy back into Johnston
elementary's neighborhood and the surrounding community. As Community
Forge finds its footing within the community, we aspire to bring in
exciting tech jobs, offer free classes, and provide recreational space
to the citizens of Wilkinsburg.
