          Bloom is our annual business incubator program. This program offers 20 small businesses coaching, strategy development, professional services, networking, education, and financial investments over a 9 month period. The program focuses on digging in deep and discovering your strategic needs and areas of your back office in most need of development. We focuse on businesses that are already generating some revenue and emphasize making sure that all participants leave with increases in revenue, clients, a better understanding of their finances, and a more organized back-office. Each participant gets a lead business coach and advisory team that helps develop and oversee the implementation of the owner's strategic goals. Further, participants receive funds toward professional services such as accounting, legal, branding, HR, and web design. They also receive access to our internal consultant network for pro bono help in developing business strategies. There will be courses and workshops available throughout the program targeting key business skills. Finally, there is a series of financial investment opportunities such as pitch competitions and cash awards for achieving growth plans. </p><br>
          <p>
           If you have questions about the program, please reach out to our program manager, Herman Johnson, herman@forge.community. <b>Applications for the 2022 Bloom cohort will open in November 2021 so keep an eye out!</b>

    <h1 class="title is-4">Community Forge Youth Advisory Council</h1>
    <p>
      Youth empowerment means not only making programs for youth, but giving youth the power to take on leadership and make decisions, especially on issues pertinent to them. The Community Forge Youth Advisory Council is a team of youth who are decision-makers at Community Forge. Currently, they lead our playground development efforts, give advice on programs, and are helping develop and run youth events.  We currently have 7 members: Antonie, Bryan, Charles, Chris, Josiah, Na'Caira and Zariah.

            Activate the Arts was a residency program to support artists in the development of their work and connect them to new opportunities through our space in Wilkinsburg.  Resident artists gained a $500 stipend, 4 professional development workshops, free admission to all Community Forge events, discounted event space, and a hot desk space in our coworking office.  This program was supported in part by <a href="https://www.newsunrising.org/">New Sun Rising</a>. The program was designed and led by Leigh Soloman Pugliano and Ariel Beach-Westmoreland.
          </p><br>
          <p>
            Our first cycle had 4 artists: Ayana Sade, Dalia Shevin, Latrice Phoenix, and Nathan Byrne.  We hosted a final showcase of their work on December 1st 2018.
