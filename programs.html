    <h1 class="title is-4">Community Forge Youth Advisory Council</h1>
    <p>
      Youth empowerment means not only making programs for youth, but giving youth the power to take on leadership and make decisions, especially on issues pertinent to them. The Community Forge Youth Advisory Council is a team of youth who are decision-makers at Community Forge. Currently, they lead our playground development efforts, give advice on programs, and are helping develop and run youth events.  We currently have 7 members: Antonie, Bryan, Charles, Chris, Josiah, Na'Caira and Zariah.

            Activate the Arts was a residency program to support artists in the development of their work and connect them to new opportunities through our space in Wilkinsburg.  Resident artists gained a $500 stipend, 4 professional development workshops, free admission to all Community Forge events, discounted event space, and a hot desk space in our coworking office.  This program was supported in part by <a href="https://www.newsunrising.org/">New Sun Rising</a>. The program was designed and led by Leigh Soloman Pugliano and Ariel Beach-Westmoreland.
          </p><br>
          <p>
            Our first cycle had 4 artists: Ayana Sade, Dalia Shevin, Latrice Phoenix, and Nathan Byrne.  We hosted a final showcase of their work on December 1st 2018.
