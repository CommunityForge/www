    <p>
      Community Forge is home to a number of programs run by our organization as well as some of our tenants. Owned and operated by our non-profit, Locally Grown, our mission is to <b>"Build an equitable economy for Wilkinsburg and the Greater Pittsburgh region by creating opportunities that promote professional development, financial wellbeing, and entrepreneurial growth. We believe in participatory programming that gives voice to those we serve, breaking down silos between communities, and developing equitable pathways to economic success."</b> We design and implement our own set of programs to achieve these aims. Please browse here to learn about our primary programs, but feel free to reach out to us with any questions, by email at hello@forge.community or use our <a href="{{ site.url }}/contact.html">contact form</a>.

          Bloom is our annual business incubator program. This program offers 20 small businesses coaching, strategy development, professional services, networking, education, and financial investments over an 8 month period. The program focuses on digging in deep and discovering your strategic needs and areas of your back office in most need of development. We focuse on businesses that are already generating some revenue and emphasize making sure that all participants leave with increases in revenue, clients, a better understanding of their finances, and a more organized back-office. Each participant gets a lead business coach and advisory team that helps develop and oversee the implementation of the owner's strategic goals. Further, participants receive funds toward professional services such as accounting, legal, branding, HR, and web design. They also receive access to our internal consultant network for pro bono help in developing business strategies. There will be courses and workshops available throughout the program targeting key business skills. Finally, there is a series of financial investment opportunities such as pitch competitions and cash awards for achieving growth plans. </p><br>
          <p>
           If you have questions about the program, please reach out to our program manager, Herman Johnson, herman@forge.community. <b>Applications for the 2022 Bloom cohort will open in January 2022 so keep an eye out!</b>

          <p>Co-run with Pittsburgh Learning Commons, the Community Forge Youth Leadership Council is a group of high schoolers living in Wilkinsburg who work with our organization's leadership to create youth opportunities and give input from a youth perspective. Each gets an individual mentor from our organization's staff and board, and meet bi-weekly to discuss things happening at the Forge, plan events, and work on their own life goals and planning. Our leadership council was featured at the National League of Cities Conference in 2020 as a keynote for their youth delegation.</p><br>

        <p>The playground of the former Johnston Elementary School has remained a staple for our community; particularly our youth. With over a 100 years of kids building relationships and families gathering, Community Forge has honored this tradition by keeping the playground as a public park for the Wilkinsburg community and all those gather at Community Forge. The space is used by 50 neighborhood youth regularly as well as the youth in our internal and resident-led programs, and is the site of many free events through the year.</p><br>

            Community Forge is working on new programming to support artists. We are currently piloting an artist sustainability program where two artists (Jacquea Mae and Kelsey Robinson) are receiving entrepreneurial training to aid in building the business around their art practice while using our facility as a catalyst for their own art making. We are currently developing new partnerships with Bricolage Production Company and the Warhol Museum and anticipate launching a pilot artist residency in 2022. Keep an eye out for new announcements coming soon.
