    <p>
      We have temporarily paused most programming to do a needs assessment and make sure our programs match what our neighbors want.  If you would like to help with the needs assessment or have input that you’d like to share, contact our programs chair: Andrew Johnson at andrew@forge.community.

    <h1 class="title is-4">Activate the Arts - Artist Residency Program</h1>
    <p>
      Activate the Arts is a residency program to support artists in the development of their work and connect them to new opportunities through our space in Wilkinsburg.  Resident artists gain a $500 stipend, 4 professional development workshops, free admission to all Community Forge events, discounted event space, and a hot desk space in our coworking office.  This program is supported in part by New Sun Rising.

      We currently have 4 artists in our program: Ayana Sade, Dalia Shevin, Latrice Phoenix, and Nathan Byrne.  Go to our <a href="{{ site.url }}/partners.html">residents page</a> to find out more.  We will be hosting a final showcase of their work in November 2018.

    <h1 class="title is-4">Community Forge Youth Advisory Council</h1>
    <p>
      Youth empowerment means not only making programs for youth, but giving youth the power to take on leadership and make decisions, especially on issues pertinent to them. The Community Forge Youth Advisory Council is a team of youth who are decision-makers at Community Forge. Currently, they lead our playground development efforts, give advice on programs, and are helping develop and run youth events.  We currently have 6 members: Antonie Smith, Bryan Finch, Charles Johnson, Chris Davis, Na’Caira Amhurst, and Zariah Harper.
