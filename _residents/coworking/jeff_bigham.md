CMU Tech Help Desk is a project of Jeff Bigham's lab out of Carnegie Mellon's HCII. They offer free technical assistance to members of Community Forge needing to update, modify, or begin using new technologies in their business practice. They focus on not only supporting the implementation of technology, but also training people so they have the know-how to manage their technology later.
